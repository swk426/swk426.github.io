[COVID-19 Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis Using Only Cough Recordings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9208795)

J. Laguarta, F. Hueto and B. Subirana, "COVID-19 Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis Using Only Cough Recordings," in IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology, vol. 1, pp. 275-281, 2020, DOI: 10.1109/OJEMB.2020.3026928.

The year 2020 has been crazy and fearful to all of us. With WHO's declaration of Pandemic on March 11, 2020, everything around us has changed. What used to be normal is not normal anymore. We have to keep physical distance from loved ones. Some of us even lost our loved ones to this deadly virus. Amid such chaos, data science has found its purpose, significance, and meaning in humanity. Our top daily news spoke about the status of COVID-19 with graphs, numbers, and plots. The data has become inseparable from all aspects of human life.

In September 2020, I found very interesting news. [Artificial intelligence model detects asymptomatic Covid-19 infections through cellphone-recorded coughs](https://news.mit.edu/2020/covid-19-cough-cellphone-detection-1029).

Massachusetts Institutes of Technology (MIT) has developed an AI model that could diagnose COVID-19 with the sound of coughing. When a subject records a forced coughing sound, the model can accurately discriminate if the subject is a normal patient, or a COVID-19 patient even if the subject is asymptomatic.  In humans' ears, it is very hard to distinguish the differences in coughing sounds. However, the machine can.

A team of researchers from MIT gathered over hundreds of thousands of coughing audio samples submitted by people voluntarily through web browsers and devices such as cellphones and laptops in April and May 2020 for training. The team picked well balanced 5,320 training samples and built a model that exhibited an accuracy of 96.3%, AUC of 0.97, and sensitivity of 98.5%.

Currently, the team is building an application that can be used for smartphones so that we can easily test ourselves whenever and wherever we want. This will be a great game-changer for our fight against the virus.

Based on my personal experience, a commonly used COVID-19 serology test kit exhibits an accuracy of 95% and costs about $20-$25 on average. The serology test kit’s result took about 30 minutes. For higher accuracy, my sample was sent to the lab and I had to wait days to get results. Moreover, the testing procedure was not easy.

Some experts forecasted the need for tens or even hundreds of millions of tests per day to fight COVID-19. The smartphone application will make diagnosis simple. It can reduce the cost, increase availability and accessibility. On top of that, it will not require the prescreening procedure. Anyone will be able to test. It will help experts to fight the virus and those who are struggling to test due to financial difficulties or time availability.

> “Information is the resolution of Uncertainty”

A famous mathematician and engineer Claude Shannon said “Information is the resolution of Uncertainty.” Thanks to the development of data science, we have a weapon to fight against such diseases that have taken away many lives. I hope to hear great news one day. Humanity has won the war against COVID-19. You can join the fight by recording your cough [here](https://opensigma.mit.edu/)
