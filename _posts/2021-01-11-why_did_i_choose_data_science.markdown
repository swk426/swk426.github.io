You have probably heard these phrases before when you searched for Data Science. “Data Science is the future!”, “The world of Data needs you.”, “the sexiest job of the 21st Century” and “Every company needs Data Science for success.” These phrases catch your attention as you are planning your career to be in the field of data science. Based on my one year of experience in Data Science, I can summarize data science as follows. It starts with understanding a business/ problem and gathering the data that could lead to the solution. With gathered data, data scientists can understand the history of a subject. With found history and understanding, they can build a machine model that can predict the future outcome. Some results are successful and some results are not so successful. The process of ongoing learning with the machine, a great partner, gives you that joy, excitement, and passion. In addition to such delight, here are 4 reasons why I chose Data Science as my future career.

## Presence
Simply, data is everywhere, sports, medical, sciences, businesses, finances, games and etc. You can name a field of industry, there is data. Because we are surrounded by the data, data scientists will always have an opportunity to work. For this reason, I can see myself work in the Data Science field for the next 30 years. It has given me a vision for the future pathway of life, which is a great reason to choose Data Science.

## Exciting and Fun
In Sports, watching commentators and experts arguing which team has the favor of winning or pointing out a key player is another fun. Experts bring their arguments and facts based on records. These records are simply the data. With gathered data, experts calculate the possibilities based on their experiences and knowledge then conclude their predictions. If you can obtain data, you can become the experts yourself. You can build models that can learn and adapt to make calculations to predict the results with given data. 

When you make a prediction and when the prediction comes true, it gives you joy and pleasure. When your built model exhibits high accuracy results, it is just as exciting as watching experts making predictions for a sports game. 
This method will not only apply to the field of sports but also any industry that involves data. Since business understanding is the key to the Data Science life cycle, you get to learn and understand many businesses. Simone Weil, a famous French philosopher and mathematician, once said "The joy of learning is as indispensable in study as breathing is in running." As a data scientist, I will continually expand my knowledge and enjoy the path.

## Needs
Next, everybody is curious about the future. “What is going to happen?”  “What’s next?” These questions are asked all the time because our life is full of choices. When you are making choices, wouldn’t it be nice to make a choice that you would not regret? Data Science can help one prepare to make decisions by providing great information on the problem. Those who are prepared will tend to have a better choice than those who are not so prepared. The famous Chinese war strategist Sun Tzu stated in “Art of War”, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” Simply put, information is the power and you need it when you make any decisions in your life.
With such a power gained through the information, not only it will provide a better life for an individual, but it will also better a community as a whole. 

## Better Community
I have always had a heart to help others who are in need. In my elementary school year, I dreamed of becoming a firefighter. Not because the job looked attractive, but because I wanted to make a positive impact on other people’s lives. In my middle school year, I dreamed of becoming a football player and playing in Europe’s big football clubs. Again because I was inspired by many football players with great sportsmanship. They were making a positive impact on people’s lives. Since high school and to my recent chapter of my life, I served my community as a Taekwondo Master. I have tried to make a positive impact on people around me. One of the reasons I changed my career is to continue making a positive impact on others but on a bigger scale. 

With the recent global pandemic that took away hundreds thousands of lives, many great data scientists have stepped up to fight the battle against COVID-19. For example, [Artificial intelligence model detects asymptomatic Covid-19 infections through cellphone-recorded coughs](https://news.mit.edu/2020/covid-19-cough-cellphone-detection-1029); a group of data scientists from MIT was able to build a model that can accurately classify COVID-19 patients by just the sound of coughing. [Francesca Dominici, co-director of the Harvard Data Science Initiative,](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/09/harvard-journal-keeps-data-scientists-connected-during-covid/) said “Data science is becoming paramount to understanding almost all of the critical aspects of COVID-19. That includes the development and testing of a COVID-19 vaccine, understanding the factors that slow the rate of infection, understanding the role of airborne transmission — which is critical to understanding whether we can reopen the schools — identifying environmental and socioeconomic factors, and tracking mobility to better understand key behavioral interventions to contain the spread of the virus.” 

## Wrap Up
If you are thinking about getting into the field of data, I welcome you with both arms spread wide. One of my favorite quotes “What would you do if you knew you would not fail?” I believe that the world of data will always exist as long as there are records and it will be a field that would not fail. Let us continually seek the opportunity, enjoy what we do, filling the needs of others and building better communities together.
